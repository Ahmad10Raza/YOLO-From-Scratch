    "#### üìå What is Object Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Detection** is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. It combines **image classification** (what is in the image?) with **object localization** (where is it in the image?).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object detection model outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bounding boxes** (coordinates around objects)\n",
    "* **Class labels** (e.g., person, car, dog)\n",
    "* **Confidence scores** (how sure the model is)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feed an image with a car and a person, the model returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[{\"label\": \"car\", \"confidence\": 0.98, \"bbox\": [x1, y1, x2, y2]},\n",

    "Object detection models can be broadly categorized into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Two-Stage Detectors (Region-Based)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* These models first generate **region proposals** (likely object regions), then classify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Examples**:\n",

    "  * **R-CNN**\n",
    "  * **Fast R-CNN**\n",

    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * High accuracy\n",
    "  * Good for tasks needing precision (e.g., medical imaging)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚ùå **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Slower, not ideal for real-time applications\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. One-Stage Detectors (Single-Shot)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* These models perform **detection and classification in one go** without region proposals.\n",
